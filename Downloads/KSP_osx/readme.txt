ChangeLog:

========================= Asteroid Redirect Mission (v0.23.5.460+) HOTFIX ================================

* This build is a quick hotfix patch to address some issues that managed to slip by testing

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed an issue with loading existing games, which would cause scenario modules (like R&D) to not load properly.
* Fixed an issue which caused Kerbals on EVA to become unresponsive after resuming a save.


========================= Asteroid Redirect Mission (v0.23.5.459) ====================================

The Asteroid Redirect Mission Patch is a special update in many ways. This time, we've partnered with NASA to produce a completely new set of features for the game, which are no

Main Features:

* Asteroids:
Kerbin is no longer alone in its orbit. Nearby are countless objects that buzz in and out of its sphere of influence, some flying by harmlessly, others on impact trajectories. Ranging in size from just a few meters through 5 size classes up to gigantic objects weighing thousands of tons, these new objects should provide a new challenge for both new and veteran players. Each asteroid is procedurally generated, so no two are the same. Also, asteroids can have samples taken from them by EVAs, providing a constant source of valuable science data, right on the edge of Kerbin's SOI.

* Object Discovery and Tracking:
Before you set out after an asteroid, you first need to identify and track them using the Tracking and Discovery features on the Tracking Station Facility. Select one of the unknown objects spotted near Kerbin, and start tracking it actively to reveal more information about it. Also mind that untracked objects can be lost if they're left unobserved for too long.

* The Advanced Grabbing Unit (aka "The Claw")
As the name probably implies, this new part is the means by which asteroids can be captured to be redirected. Just arm the device, approach the target carefully, and the claw will do the rest. It's like a docking node, but without the need for a mate node on the other side. Better still, the AGU can be used to grab on to much more than just asteroids. In fact, it can pick up just about anything, even Kerbals.

* New SLS-inspired Size 3 parts:
 We've added a host of new parts, featuring the largest engines and fuel tanks ever seen in KSP. These new parts were designed based on NASA's upcoming Space Launch System, and they pack a huge amount of rocket power. Here they are:
 - Size 3 Liquid Fuel + Oxy Tanks, in Full, Half and Quarter-Sized Variants
 - 4x Size 3 Engine Cluster. The single most powerful piece of rocketry we've ever added to KSP.
 - Advanced Size 3 Single-Nozzle Engine, for when you need immense amounts of thrust in your upper stages
 - New Liquid Fuel Booster: A new way to boost your spacecraft, the LFB is a single part featuring twin engines, plus a very respectable amount of fuel. What more, you can even stack more liquid fuel tanks on top of it.
 - The Launch Escape System: Modelled after the Apollo LES, this new escape tower can save your crew should you underestimate the sheer power of your new rockets.

* Completely Overhauled Part Joints:
We have completely re-done the way parts attach to one another, to allow for much greater flexibility and control over each joint. Joints are also more accurate and stable, as both jointed sides are now anchored at the attachment node (this wasn't possible before the Unity 4.3 update).
 - Large parts also have a new system that allows them to attach much more rigidly to other parts, eliminating many cases where spamming struts was required.
 - Increased PhysX's global max angular velocity settings to improve joint stability.
 - Angular inertia values for parts now properly scale with mass. Some ships may feel heavier to fly now, but handling feels much more realistic overall. This also improves joint stability a lot.
 - Re-did the Strut Connector joints as well, to use the new joints system instead of their old ones. This dramatically improved their reliability and significantly reduced the number of ocurrences where ships spontaneously disassemble themselves on the launchpad.



New Features:

* Added new buttons to the Map Filtering panel to filter Unknown and SpaceObject type vessels.
* Focusing vessels on the Tracking Station will now display their patched conics trajectory.
* Added Time Warp controls to the Tracking Station and Space Center scenes.
* Added a button to the Time quadrant in the main flight UI to allow switching betwen Mission Time and Universal Time.
* Targeted vessels now display their trajectories as patched conics instead of single orbits.
* Maneuver Nodes are now persistent.
* Targeted Objects are now persistent.
* Added buttons to discard/accept maneuvers on the delta-v gauge by the navball.
* Added buttons to add/remove an orbit to the date of a maneuver node, allowing nodes to be planned for several orbits ahead.
* Maneuver handles can now be fine-tweaked with the mousewheel when hovering over them.
* RCS and XenonGas containers on earlier stages are now drained before containers on later stages.
* Celestial Bodies now show a 'Focus View' button on their context menus in Map View.

Bug Fixes and Tweaks:

* Celestial bodies you have an encounter patch with will display that patch in local mode when they are focused on the Map View or Tracking Station.
* Switching between Linear and Rotation controls in Docking UI mode no longer toggles SAS.
* Fixed a bug where patched conics on extremely eccentric orbits could break the simulation at very high warp speeds.
* Fixed incorrect rendering of ascending and descending nodes when targeting a non-closed orbit.
* Fixed a bug where targeting an object on a hyperbolic orbit wouldn't display rendezvous information on the map.
* Tweaked the thrust and Isp values of Ion Engines and the two tiny rocket engines. All were severely underpowered to be of any practical use.
* Quicksaving is now allowed at all times. In unstable situations, an autosave won't be created at the same time.  
* Greatly improved the accuracy of the physics->rails transition, eliminating drift on nearby vessels when warping during a rendezvous situation, especially high-velocity ones.
* The Map Filtering buttons now toggle independently on left click, and toggle single/all on right click.
* Fixed several cases where Kerbals on EVA would glitch out in very painful ways, mostly when the game changed reference frames while they were in ragdoll state.
* Intersection nodes between orbits no longer 'skip' the closest intersection when placing a maneuver node near the player's position.

==================================== v0.23.0 =========================================================

New:

* The Science Archives:
- Browse through all the science you've done in your Career games in this new section of the R&D Facility. 

* Tweakables:
- Several parts can now be tweaked individually by right-clicking them during construction. 
- Landing Gear can be set to start out deployed or retracted, and can also be made steerable.
- Engines can have a thrust limiter set on them, so you can balance out asymmetrical thruster configurations (or use differential thrust for taxiing).
- Wheels can be tweaked to have their engines toggled, steering locked, all before launch (and after, of course).
- Control Surfaces can be tweaked to toggle response to pitch, roll and yaw input individually. 

* Science Revisited:
- Transmitting scientific data no longer allows you to max out the value of a subject just by repeating the transmission multiple time.
- Removing the experiment data from some experiment modules (for transmission or by EVA) will render them inoperable.
- Resetting an experiment can still be done freely as long as the data is not removed from the module.

* Solar System:
- Added a new Biome Map for Minmus.
- Cleaned up the Biome Maps for Kerbin and the Mun, to remove areas where Biomes would be detected incorrectly.

* The Lab Module:
- Added a new part called a Laboratory Module, which allows experiment data and samples to be processed before transmission, increasing their science value.
- The Lab Module requires 2 crews inside to operate and a whole lot of power as well. 
- Added a new button to the experiment review dialog to process collected data on the Lab if one is available (and operational) on your vessel.

* EVA Data Transport:
- Kerbals on EVA can now collect the data from experiment modules and store them on crew-carrying modules.
- Kerbals can also collect data from other data container modules, including other Kerbals.
- EVAs can also store samples collected from other experiments on the Lab. 

* Part Tooltips Overhaul:
- The tooltips that pop up when mousing over a part on the editors have been completely redesigned.
- The tooltips show essential info only at first, but can be expanded to show more info with RMB.
- Once expanded, you can right-click again to collapse, or to pin other tooltips if you hover over other parts.
- Re-organized the part information to group stats for each module and resource container on a part.
- Added a larger icon for the part on the tooltip itself, featuring a scale to give an idea of size before picking. 

* All-around Optimizations:
- We've gone over all our code to make sure it runs as efficiently as possible.
- Upgraded to Unity version 4.2.2 to make full use of its own bugfixes and tweaks.
- Texture loading has been sped up, loading times are noticeably reduced.

* [Windows-Only] 6-DOF Device Support:
- 6-DOF input devices such as the Space Navigator are now supported both as camera and flight controllers.
- Scroll Lock will toggle the device mode in flight.
- Due to driver limitations this is a Windows-only feature for now. We're ready to implement support in OSX and Linux as soon as those drivers become available.


Bug Fixes and Tweaks:

* Parts:
- The logic for all-vessel resource flow (such as Electric Charge and MonoPropellant) has been re-done. 
- Fixed those resource containers not being able to drain fully or store an amount larger than their current available space.

* Docking:
- Fixed an issue that caused docking ports to resume their states incorrectly after docking, making it impossible to undock afterwards.
- Fixed a big issue with docking operations through physicsless parts in the hierarchy between the port and the original vessel root.

* EVAs:
- EVAs now use actual MonoPropellant for their jetpacks, instead of their own fuel. 
- Fixed an issue with collision resolution that caused EVAs to sometimes fall over and become uncontrollable.
- Kerbals other than you will now pick themselves up from ragdoll state if they are involved in any 'accidents' or are flat out being used as Kerbowling pins.
- Parts that land onto splashed-down parts are now considered to be landed. This allows EVAs to walk on floating platforms.

* Other Fixes:
- The Return key will no longer reset the staging sequence in the Editors, or return you to the Main Menu at KSC.
- The Main Menu now remembers the 'page' you were at when you left it, so if you return from a loaded game, you'll find it still at the "Start Game" screen.
- Fixed several issues with joystick axis mapping and indexing.
- Updated the Input settings screen to expose a few new control options that weren't accessible before.
- Fixed an issue that could lead to loss of GUI responsiveness after leaving flight during reentry or supersonic flight.

==================================== v0.22.0 =========================================================

New:

* Career Mode:
- Career Mode is now open! Although still very much under development, you can now start new Career saves.
- Sandbox mode, of course, is also available from the start.

* Research and Development:
- Added the Research & Development Facility to the Space Center.
- R&D allows players to unlock parts (and later other stuff) by researching nodes on the Tech Tree (In Career Mode).

* Science:

- You can now collect surface samples while on EVA, and process them to do Science.
- Science experiments return results, which are different for each situation in which the experiment is performed. 
- Experiments can (as all proper experiments must) be repeated over many different situations across the whole Solar System. 
- Added a new dialog to show the results of experiments when reviewing the collected data.
- Added a new dialog to show a breakdown of all scientific progress made after recovering a mission.

* Parts: 
- Added new scientific parts, like the Materials Bay and the Mystery Goo™ Canister. Also added experiments to many existing parts.
- The old science sensors now have a purpose. They all have their own experiments which enable them to log scientific data.
- The antennas are now functional, and can be used to transmit science data back to Kerbin, if recovering the physical experiments is not an option.
- Antennas consume massive amounts of power when transmitting. Make sure you have fresh batteries in.
- Added a new deployable antenna, which is an intermediate model compared to the two original ones.
- Completely remodelled the Communotron 88-88 Comms Dish. The new mesh uses the same placement rules so it won't break ships that have it.
- Nose Cones now actually help with improving stability during atmospheric flight.
- Revised a lot of part values and descriptions, in preparation for them actually meaning something in the near future.
- Overhauled the landing legs and gears, they now have proper shock-absorbing suspensions.

* Editor:
- Added a system to allow saving and loading of Sub-Assemblies.
- Subassemblies are subsets of spacecraft, which can later be attached to other designs and re-used.

* Space Center:
- The KSC Facilities have all been revised, and feature new ground meshes and many other graphical improvements.
- Greatly improved the Island Airfield. 
- Added lighting FX to several facilities. The Runway (among many other things) is now properly lit at night.
- Added a new backdrop and soundtrack for the Astronaut Complex Facility.
- Added a new music track for the R&D Facility.

* Flight:
- It is now possible to recover a flight after landing/splashdown on Kerbin without going through the Tracking Station. Look above the Altimeter.
- The SAS system was again largely overhauled, based on all the feedback we've gotten from everyone. It's now stabler than ever.

* Solar System:
- Celestial Bodies now support Biome Maps, which are used to create different conditions for experiments. 
- Biomes are currently implemented on Kerbin and on the Mun, more will be added on later updates.

* Launcher:
- We've got a new launcher application for KSP, featuring a news bulletin, patcher management, and also allows you to tweak settings from outside the game.

* Windows and OSX Installers:
- The KSPStore version of the game can now also be downloaded as an installer wizard on Windows, and as a .dmg image on OSX.

Bug Fixes and Tweaks:
* Fixed an issue that caused a stream of errors to be thrown after planting a flag and opening the map.
* Fixed several minor and not-so-minor issues with scene transitions.
* Greatly improved the scene transition times. Loading delays between scenes should be significantly reduced.

* Tweaked the ocean color at sea level on Kerbin (was way too dark).
* Fixed an issue that would cause lag while moving parts around the editor scenes if too many crews were hired at the same time.
* Fixed an issue with the new SAS not properly maintaining attitude. Should be much better now.
* Tweaked some parameters on the SAS to make it more responsive.

==================================== v0.21.0 =========================================================

New:

* Space Center Scene:
- The Space Center scene now uses the same terrain as in flight.
- Time now passes in the Space Center scene, and day/night is consistent with in-flight.
- The game terrain persists across scene transitions, making loading scenes much faster.

* Construction:
- Completely overhauled the interior models for the VAB and SPH buildings, complete with animated trucks and cargo lifts.
- All-new exterior models for the VAB, SPH and Tracking Station.
- New Astronaut Complex building.
- Added a description field where you can write up a few lines to describe your space-faring contraptions.

* Crew Management:
- It is now possible to assign crew manually to missions before launch, both from the Construction Facilities and from Launch Sites.
- Added completely new Launch Dialogs on the Runway and Launchpad at the Space center.
- The new Astronaut Complex dialog allows you to hire crews from a list of Applicants, and view the status of all your crewmembers.
- Revised the crew handling game logic, for a much more reliable and robust system.

* SAS Modules:
- Rewrote the SAS control logic from the ground up.
- SAS is now enabled for the entire vessel, and requires actuators like winglets, RCS or others to actually have an effect.
- Repurposed the old SAS modules are now Reaction Wheel Modules, that apply torque while consuming electricity.
- The new SAS logic allows applying manual input while SAS is on, letting you set the ship's attitude without having to constantly toggle it.

* Procedural Terrain:
- Added a new module to generate craters procedurally on the Mun.
- Largely revised Kerbin's terrain to produce much more interesting mountains, hills, valleys and coastlines.

* Flight Re-Flow:
- Removed the physically-impossible "End Flight" button.
- Added new options to "Revert" a mission back to launch or to construction.
- Added new 'Recover' button on the Tracking Station, to allow recovering a vessel (as opposed to Terminating it) when possible.
- Recovering vessels makes its crew available again, while Terminating kills them.
- The 'Space Center' button now allows you to leave flight at any time, warning when necessary about saving restrictions.

* Progress Tracking:
- The game now tracks your progress as you play, providing essential data for the upcoming Career Mode features.
- Progress data is (optionally) uploaded to our servers, 

* Misc:
- Improved the in-game shadowing to enable shadows at much larger distances.
- Added several new parts from the KSPX pack as stock content.


Bug Fixes and Tweaks:
- Scenario Modules now properly save and load when the rest of the game saves and loads.
- Scenario Modules can now have multiple target scenes set.
- Improved the internal logic for switching to nearby vessels, it shouldn't refuse to switch with valid vessels nearby anymore.
- Added a system to attempt upgrading incompatible save files if/when possible. 
- Tweaked PQS on other planets and moons to not initialize until approached. Improved performance a bit.

- Added a Flag selector to the Game Start Dialog.
- Added a Flag Pole Facility to the Space Center.
- Added a FlagDecal part module. Allows any part to have a part of its model textured with the selected flag.

* Editor:
- Added Flag selector to Editor scenes, to select a flag for the mission (defaults to space program flag).
- The Editor no longer requires that the first part on a vessel be a Command Pod.
- Any part which allows both stacking and surface-attaching can be used as the vessel root.
- Added a new part filtering system to the parts list, which allows excluding and greying-out parts based on any criteria.
- It is now possible to delete the first part on a vessel, and replace it.

* UI:
- Added the first iteration of the Kerbal Knowledge Base: A collection of vessel and planetary information on the Map and Tracking Station.
- The Knowledge Base shows information about known Celestial Bodies, displays the crews inside vessels, and much more.
- Added Filtering by vessel type on the Tracking Station.
- Added Filtering to the Map View as well (hover around the top-center of the screen)
- New Loading Screens, with hints.

* I/O:
- GameDatabase: Completely overhauled the loading process with a completely new system.
- Mods and Stock Parts can now have their own separate folders for organization.
- Added a Flags folder to collect flag bitmaps.
- Added a scene transition buffer system, to ensure optimal memory cleanup when switching scenes.

* Controls:
- Switching vessels no longer resets throttle and other input whenever possible.
- Going on EVA and boarding a vessel (or boarding a seat) also no longer reset the vessel's input state.
- Decoupled vessels inherit the old vessel's control state. 
- All parts on a stage will get activated now, even if that stage causes some of those parts to get jettisoned away.


Bug Fixes and Tweaks:

- Streamlined PQS Terrain Assets, reduced memory usage by up to 30%.
- Upgraded Debug Menu, allows reloading parts and cfg files while playing.
- The Map View now properly prioritizes selecting moused-over map nodes when multiple orbits overlap.
- It's now possible to 'pin' the Ap and Pe nodes, so their captions remain visible after moving the mouse away.
- Removed the Splash Screen scene. Now the game starts loading as soon as the application starts.
- Rewrote and organized many scattered game events into a single coherent GameEvents System, which plugins can use.
- If you crash/explode, focus now shifts to the nearest controllable vessel (if any) instead of going straight to the End Flight dialog.

* Fixed an issue with warping time after crashing.
* Fixed an issue where flying through a Mun arch would destroy the vessel.
* Fixed an issue with Launch Clamps at 2x warp and above.
* Fixed an issue with the G force calculation for vessels, which could prevent saving or warping.

==================================== v0.17.0 x1====================================================

New:
* Internal Cockpit Views: The first iteration of the IVAs (Intra-Vehicular Activities) feature set.

* Multiple Player Saves: You can now have multiple ongoing game sessions, as each save is kept in its own folder (instead of all using the saves/default one). 

* Quick Flight Scenarios: Start flights from pre-set conditions, without interfering with your persistent sandbox save, and also save your own scenarios from your main game.

* Scenario Logic Modules: Like PartModules, but for scene logic (and defined on an SFS file instead of a part.cfg).

* Training Scenarios: Hands-On tutorials to teach you everything from craft construction to orbital maneuvers.

* Center of mass, thrust, lift and drag visual cues on the construction scenes.

* Prebuilt ships included with the game, as examples and possible starting points.

* Fixed an issue where any parts exploding on the focused vessel would cause the Flight End dialog to appear.
* Fixed an issue where empty vessels would sometimes be controllable after switching to them.
* Fixed the Retractable Ladders not saving their states properly.
* Landing Legs now use a much improved collision handling system, eliminating leg wobble on heavy ships.
* PartTools can now serialize WheelCollider components.

* Fixed a problem where Kerbals would collide and crash against ladder triggers attached to parts.
* Improved detection/response to vessels below terrain and much better terrain altitude detection for vessels.
* It is no longer possible to save the game (or switch vessels) while very close to the ground and not landed (could cause terrain fallthrough).
* Fixed an issue that could cause the game to crash when starting an EVA.
* Kerbals on ladders no longer get teleported when packed (they just let go).
* Retracting a ladder with a Kerbal on it while in orbit will no longer cause them to go on random trajectories.
* Fixed an issue where older parts that still used direct DAE or OBJ model loading wouldn't have their collision meshes rescaled.
* Fixed a problem with EVAs saving the fuel value, which sometimes caused a conflict that could lead to a game crash.

  going through the ground. (all thanks to above fix)

* [API Change] MemoryStream wrappers that were mistakenly not committed for 1.15.1 have been added to the code.

* Packing/Unpacking ships is now done without affecting the ship's scene hierarchy.

* Fixed a bug in the Tracking Station scene, which prevented scrolling the vessel list.

* The Vessel Switching keys now only cycle between nearby vessels and won't cause the scene to reload anymore.
  To switch to far-away vessels, you must use the map view.

* (Possibly) increased performance on the flight scenes (from the terrain tweak also)
* Found and fixed the true cause of the orbit NaN bug.

==================================== v0.14.1 ======================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Found and fixed the real cause of the staging issues that have plagued every release from 13.2 onward.
* The debug console is no longer spammed with NaN errors. This could cause extreme lag in densely populated game worlds.
* Fixed an issue where unloaded vessels would not update their orbits, causing them to resume incorrectly if they switched SOIs.
* Fixed the save folder paths on the Mac version (they were ending up inside the app package)
* It is now possible to do a Quickload (F9) after a crash (with the flight end screen up).
* The game will no longer overwrite the quicksave when resuming flights. Only when creating new ones.

==================================== v0.14.0x6 ======================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed yet another staging issue.
* Fixed an issue with the object scaling for Bill, Bob and Jeb, which made them not sit right in the cockpit and their screen messages to not appear.
* Fixed a game flow issue in which it was possible to cancel the flight end screen, leading to an error and leaving the game stuck in the flight scene.
* Fixed an issue which might have caused repeated Kerbals to be generated. 
* Fixed the End Flight screen lockup issue after KIA.
* Fixed the problem with landed vessels being lobbed into the air after resuming a saved flight.
* Fixed the small fuel tank visual gap when connected to the mk1 pod directly.
* Fixed the tracking station rotation and texturing issues.




==================================== v0.14.0x5 ======================================================
New:
* Added small fuel tank and small engine parts

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed an issue that caused parts to be detected as landed when in collision with parts from other vessels, even while flying.
* Fixed an issue where the persistence system would not clean out parts that were landed on other parts, rather than on the launchpad or KSC area.
* Unloaded orbiting vessels will continue orbiting into the ground, if there is no atmosphere to reentry-burn them.
* The 'isPersistent' part cfg parameter, ironically enough, wasn't persistent itself.
* Removed an 'experimental' tweak done on the terrain shader that caused the Mun to look very bright in bright areas, and very dark in dark ones.
* Added an icon image for Landing Legs.
* Fixed the buttons of the pod selection window not responding to clicks when the VAB tutorial was active.
* Fixed the VAB tutorial never being shown after the first time, even when activated in the settings.
* Fixed the tutorial window disappearing behind the command pod selection window.
* Changed the ground detection system to a far more stable hold-and-release method.
* Added an icon for the landing legs (and made it update its colours)
* Tweaked the landing leg collision mesh to avoid phantom forces from poorly-solved collisions
* Updated the description for landing legs (missing description for the other parts)



==================================== v0.14.0x4 ======================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed a problem with Jeb's confidence levels (he lost his nerve on x3).
* Fixed a few issues with the atmospheric pressure and temperature curves from x3.
* Fixed another problem with staging that was made apparent in x3. It caused the ship to 'skip' stages.


==================================== v0.14.0x3 ======================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed the vessel label icons, which were invisible.
* Increased the ejection force of Decouplers and Radial Decouplers (too underpowered after the physics fix).
* Removed the landingleg.max file that snuck itself into the distribution.
* Fixed the Camera Mode text not being displayed in flight.
* Fixed the map focus switching (Tab not working).
* Fixed Fuel tanks apparently not resuming fuel levels properly (was an icon issue).
* Fixed Landing legs not resuming their states properly.
* If a landed vessel decoupled from its base while taking off, the vessel would still be flagged as being landed.
* Sometimes, landed vessels would spawn a few feet off the ground and stay locked in place forever.
* SAS and ASAS modules on other vessels were getting activated along with the current focused vessel.
* Reloaded parts were not storing references to their symmetry counterparts properly. That caused all sorts of weird behaviour.
* Fixed an issue that caused vessels to be placed in the wrong positions occasionally (most noticeable in the tracking station).
* Fixed an issue that caused incorrect staging when loading ships in the flight scene.

==================================== v0.14.0x2 ======================================================

Bug Fixes:
* The KSC buildings had lost their tags which identified them as eligible for landed debris clean up. Fixed now.
* Fixed the flight scene time step being incorrectly initialized as 0.04ms (would cause wobbly physics).
* Fixed a problem with the Plugins folder in the Mac version, which caused the game to halt when loading.
* Removed a save file that sneaked its way into the distribution.

==================================== v0.14.0x1 ======================================================

* Support for multiple simultaneous flights and switching from ship to ship.
* The Tracking Station Facility at the Space Center, allows you to select and resume a flight in progress.
* Holding the middle mouse button will allow you to rotate the flight camera about itself, instead of rotating its pivot. (double-clicking the MMB will recenter it)
* Tweaked the orbit rendering on the Map View to reduce clutter when several icons are moused over at the same time.
* Landed or Splashed vessels now display their coordinates (or location, if available) when moused over on the Map View.

* An External Module Loader, which enables mod makers to program their own part modules.

Bug Fixes:
* The flight camera is no longer able to go upside down.
* The ORBITAL camera mode will no longer change orientations when switching spheres of influence.
* Fixed an issue with .craft file saving and loading, which makes it possible to save ship titles independently of the file name.

* Landed/Splashed vessels no longer show an Apoapsis icon on the Map View.
* The Map Camera now responds to the keyboard bindings for camera zoom.
* Decouplers now obey the second law of physics (Acceleration = Force/Mass)
* Decouplers now obey the third law of physics (every action has an equal and opposite reaction).
* RCS Fuel Tanks now drain symmetrically if placed using symmetry.


==================================== v0.13.3 (Demo)===================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed a bug with symmetry in the VAB. 
* Fixed an issue with the main camera that would create sporadic moments of lag in map view.
* Fixed a bug that caused symmetrical parts to lose the reference to one of their counterparts, leading to incorrect symmetrical placements. 
* Reverted the Staging logic to the 13.1 system, as the changes made in 13.2 were buggy. 


==================================== v0.13.2 ======================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed a bug with symmetry in the VAB.
* Fixed an issue with the main camera that would create sporadic moments of lag in map view.

Bug Fixes:
* Removed parent-wise fuel crossfeed from Radial Decouplers. Fuel Lines made that obsolete.
* Fixed an issue that prevented attachment nodes from affecting connected part rotations properly.
* Fixed an issue with the part loader, which would crash if a binary mesh was found, but no .dae or .obj file was present.


==================================== v0.13.1x1 ====================================================

New:
* Recompiled on the latest version of the Unity engine, to add multithreaded rendering support and better memory management.
* Changed the Fuel Line flow direction, so fuel will flow from the first-placed end of the line to the second end.
* Holding Ctrl and clicking on a part on the ship at the VAB will now automatically flip the parts list to the selected part's page.
* Added in-game credits

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed the custom part sounds loading system, which wasn't working on the last release.
* The part loader will no longer freeze if it cannot find a part module to load. It will load the base Part module, and make it visible but unavailable on the VAB.


==================================== v0.13.0 ======================================================

* Official Release

==================================== v0.13.0x4 ====================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Increased the heat conductivity and heat dissipation values for all parts, to compensate for the new heat exchange system.
* Fixed the time quadrant on the UI being unresponsive to mouse clicks if there were part icons behind it.
* Fixed the staging quadrant being partially visible in the map view.
* Fixed a problem that made it possible to delete the command pod in the VAB by using Ctrl+Z.


==================================== v0.13.0x3 ====================================================

Optimizations:
* Tweaked the part heat exchange model, for a considerable fps boost with very large ships

New:
* Added a new icon for the Fuel Line parts.
* Changed the icon grouping rule on RCS Blocks and Strut Connectors to group to all parts of the same type on it's stage.


==================================== v0.13.0x2 ====================================================

New:
* Pressing F2 will hide the UI completely (so you can take UI-free screenshots).

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed the weird 'glass-like' artifacts in game during launch
* Fixed the parts not receiving mouse events on the VAB. This also affected collision detection on the VAB.
* Fixed the in-flight settings screen being drawn under the main UI.
* Tweaked the fuel tank surface attachment point. It was a little too close to the collider, and sometimes caused false collisions.
* Fixed a bug with the parts code that allowed them to bypass receiving gravity and drag forces if it's hierarchy root was destroyed.
* Fixed the map camera code so that it will remember where it was if you re-open it. (this tweak was left out of the X1 build apparently)
* Fixed the part icon numbers (when multiple icons are grouped) not being positioned correctly on a few resolutions.



==================================== v0.13.0x1 ====================================================

Optimizations:
* Removed a lot of needless halts on the part processing routine during loading.
* Restructured the sound loading system so the main loading thread doesn't wait for it to finish before moving on.
* Deferred adding of several part components so they're only added when they're needed.
* Mesh tangents can now be loaded from file, instead of being recalculated every time.
* The mesh loader now ignores materials from file, because they were going to be replaced anyway later.
* Meshes are now saved to binary files (serialized) when loaded for the first time, and loaded from those files when they're available.
* Changed the rendering method for the part icons on the staging sequence. This can prevent thousands of objects from being created when flying large ships.
* Ship parts now have adjustable levels of physics, so small parts are not as deeply simulated as large ones. This reduces the amount of physics objects and joints to simulate.
* Reduced the amount of code components attached to each part, making for less calls on each frame.


New:
* The part loader will check if the saved optimized meshes are out-of-date, and update them when necessary.
* A new Fuel Line part, that allows fuel to be drained off external (side-mounted) tanks.
* It is now possible to warp time freely when the ship is landed.
* Added a progress bar for the loading screen.

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed the mission timer not getting started if the first stage was moved before launching.
* Liquid Fuel now flows from the "top" attachment node, instead of from the parent part (unless there is no top node, in which case it flows from the parent part).
* Parts now keep the references to the part attached in each attachment node. (makes top-node based fuel flow possible)
* Fixed a bug which prevented the ship selection dialogs from receiving double-click events. Now it is possible to select a ship file by double clicking on it.
* Improved rendering of hyperbolic (escape) orbits in the map view. The trajectory is now a constant size regardless of eccentricity, and isn't warped by the splines.
* The Map camera will now remember it's last position, and return to it when the map is reopened.

NOTES: 
* The new part loading system will generate optimized meshes for all parts whenever it finds new part models. This means the first time you run the game, it might take longer for loading to complete.

* This update introduces some new features that make ships built on previous versions incompatible. If a ship fails to load, it's because it isn't compatible with this version. We apologize for the inconvenience.

==================================== v0.12.0 ======================================================

* Official Release

==================================== v0.12.0x5 ====================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Removed the SAS disabling itself when going into Map View or into high warp rates.
* Implemented a new Kepler Equation solver for extremely high eccentricity orbits, the old one was becoming unstable and freezing the game.

==================================== v0.12.0x4 ====================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed a problem with the Floating Origin system which caused the ship to jitter on very high warp rates and speeds. (aka The Warp Shakes)
* Fixed another problem which could cause the game to crash if entering/leaving another planet's SOI while on 1x or 2x warp.
* (Hopefully) fixed a problem with 0 inclination orbits that could cause them to become reversed or rotated when transitioning between planets/moons.


==================================== v0.12.0x3 ====================================================

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed a problem that caused ships to reverse direction when unwarping while on a hyperbolic orbit.
* Fixed a few typos in some part descriptions.

Bug Fixes:
* The game would crash if the VAB tutorial is advanced too far while keeping the command module selection window open.

* Fixed the Max G reading on the flight end screen. Now it will only log sustained G forces.
* Fixed the Surface/Orbital Speed reading getting messed up when restarting a flight.
* Fixed a problem with the Time Warp code, that would sometimes force the time rate to 2x, but not unpack the ship. It would also cause G forces and other values to be incorrectly calculated.
* Fixed a problem with unpacking the ship for physics that could cause centers of mass to be offset, leading to uncontrollable tumbling.
* Fixed a problem that could cause orbits to become reversed when entering/leaving another planet's sphere of influence.
* Changed the Time Warp altitude restrictions to be proportional to the current planet or moon's radius.


==================================== v0.12.0x1 ====================================================

New:
* A Moon

* Fixed the Advanced SAS icon showing as a question mark on the VAB.
* Fixed a bug where cloning parts by removing and undoing would cause them to receive duplicate IDs (and crash the game when loading the ship again).
* Tidied up the flight statistics numbers formatting a bit, so they're easier to make sense of.
* Time Warp will now smoothly increase/decrease towards the set time rate, for a much more fluid transition.
* Made several improvements to the Map View orbit rendering.
* Fixed the rails->physics transition, so that there is no significant change anymore in orbital parameters when going out of warp.
* Made some significant improvements to the physical joints that hold the ship together. Ships will not wobble anymore when going back into 1x time after warping, and the joints themselves are more stable overall.
* Made a small tweak to the part tooltips on the VAB, to prevent them from going off-screen on small resolutions. (was noticeable with the new command pod selection dialog)

* High-speed wind sound was audible for no apparent reason on map view
* Time warp dropped to 4x even though there were higher possible options available (when altitude goes below the lower limit for a time rate)
* Orbital time was running much faster than it should at 2x and 4x warp.
* Fixed the Kepler Equation solver in the orbit system, which was causing a number of problems when going into and out of high warp rates.
